Trusted Path Execution (TPE) Linux Kernel Module

===============================================================================

About this module

Trusted Path Execution is a security feature that denies users from executing
programs that are not owned by root, or are writable. This closes the door on a
whole category of exploits where a malicious user tries to execute his or her
own code to hack the system.

Since this module doesn't use any kind of ACLs, it works out of the box with no
configuration. It isn't complicated to test or deploy to current production
systems. Just install it and you're done!

===============================================================================

WARNING! Use at your own risk!

Although stable on tested systems, I have never used your system before. I can
not guarantee that it won't crash your system, melt your hard drive, get you
fired from your job, and/or any other horrible event. Use at your own risk.

Installation

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Configuration

Although most people will find they don't need to change the default values,
you have the option to configure various things in this module at runtime using
the sysctl interface to tighten or lax the TPE restrictions. You can see the
values in this proc directory:

/proc/sys/tpe/

softmode	- log what would be denied, but dont actually deny. default off
strict		- enforce some TPE features even on trusted users. default on
check_file	- check file owner/mode in addition to directory. default on
kill		- kill the offending process and its parent when it gets denied
		  execution from TPE, unless it's root. default off
log		- whether to log denied execs to the ring buffer. default on
log_max		- maximun parent processes in a single log entry. default 50
log_floodburst	- number of log entries before logging is disabled. default 5
log_floodtime	- seconds until re-enabling logging after floodburst. default 5
paranoid	- denies execs for root of files not owned by root. default off
trusted_gid	- gid of "trusted users" who TPE is not enforced. default 1337
admin_gid	- files belonging to this group are treated as if they're owned
		  by root; TPE is not enforced on them. default 0 (off)
dmz_gid		- users in this gid can't exec anything at all. default 0 (off)

extras/		- directory for additional protections that aren't TPE related.
		  These protections are all off by default, and are as follows:

dmesg		- denies non-root users from viewing the kernel ring buffer
lsmod		- denies non-root users from viewing loaded kernel modules
proc_kallsyms	- denies non-root users from viewing /proc/kallsyms
ps		- denies non-root users from viewing processes they don't own
ps_gid		- gid of users who aren't restricted by ps. default 0 (off)

Supported Kernels

This has been tested on the following systems (x86, both 32 and 64bit):

 - RHEL/CentOS 5 (linux-2.6.18)
 - RHEL/CentOS 6 (linux-2.6.32)
 - RHEL/Centos Xen, both xenU (el5) and pvops (el6)
 - RHEL/CentOS KVM**
 - Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (linux-2.6.32)
 - Ubuntu 11.04 (linux-2.6.38)

This module *should* work on most 2.6 linux kernels, but has only been verified
on the above systems.

**There is an outstanding bug where some KVM virtual machines crash when tpe is
loaded. If this affects you, apply the kvm_fix.patch and recompile, and the
problem should go away.

===============================================================================

Compatibility Issues

Test this module before deploying to a critical system, especially if you're
not using a kernel in the above "Supported Kernels" list.

Trusted Path Execution will cause some programs to stop functioning correctly.
If it doesn't result in a kernel BUG or other stack-trace to show up in dmesg,
it's the program that needs fixing, not this module. A way to work around this
problem is adding the uid of the user these broken programs run as to the
"Trusted GID" group, so TPE is not enforced on them. You can set this group id
in /proc/sys/tpe/trusted_gid 

This module will not work on systems where loadable kernel module support is
disabled at compile time (CONFIG_MODULES not being set).

If you custom compile your own kernel and want TPE, consider using grsecurity
instead of this module.

TPE Coverage

This code was stared as a "proof of concept" and turned into a useable security
tool. It may not cover all entry points that TPE needs to cover. If you find a
way to bypass the trusted path, let me know, and I'll update this code.

With that I learned how to hijack system calls and bypass the "general
protection fault" which has previously been blocking me from doing this.

There were a few not-so-minor bugs in this module, and I asked this question on
Stack Overflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6434701/having-trouble-wrapping-functions-in-the-linux-kernel

Eugene helped me out and shared code which is now in use by this module, which
has made it stable.

 - Brad Spengler - http://grsecurity.net/

TPE is part of grsecurity, and I pulled some code from that project to make
this module.
