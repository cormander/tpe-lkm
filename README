Trusted Path Execution (TPE) Linux Kernel Module, Version 2

===============================================================================

About this module

Trusted Path Execution is a security feature that denies users from executing
programs that are not owned by root, or are writable. This closes the door on a
whole category of exploits where a malicious user tries to execute his or her
own code to attack the system.

Since this module doesn't use any kind of ACLs, it works out of the box with no
configuration. It isn't complicated to test or deploy to current production
systems. Just install it and you're done!

===============================================================================

Supported Kernels

Version 2 has been tested on the following systems (x86_64 only):

 - RHEL/CentOS 7 (linux-3.10.0)

Version 1 works on older kernels, as far back as RHEL/CentoS 5 (linux-2.6.18)

This module *should* work on most linux kernels version 3.10 and above, but has
only been verified on the above systems. If you get a compile error or a kernel
oops, please contact this module's author.

NOTE: I have tested this on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (linux-4.8.0-39-generic) but had
to remove the sysctl table to get it to compile. Full support depends on how
much time I have to dedicate to writing/testing the #if KERNEL_VERSION macros.

===============================================================================

Features

* Trusted Path Execution; deny execution of non-root owned or writable binaries

  $ gcc -o exploit exploit.c
  $ chmod 755 exploit
  $ ./exploit
  -bash: ./exploit: Permission denied

  $ dmesg | tail -n1
  [tpe] Denied untrusted exec of /home/corey/exploit (uid:500) by /bin/bash
  (uid:500), parents: /usr/sbin/sshd (uid:500), /usr/sbin/sshd (uid:0),
  /sbin/init (uid:0). Deny reason: directory uid not trusted

See the "Configuration" section below for how to tweak configuration.

===============================================================================

How it works

This module makes use of the kernel ftrace framework. In a nutshell, ftrace is
in charge of the first few bytes of most kernel symbols, and can redirect them
to other addresses. TPE instructs ftrace to redirect certain security handlers
to TPE code, which then decides whether it's appropriate to continue or not.

Configuration

Although most people will find they don't need to change the default values,
you have the option to configure various things in this module at runtime using
the sysctl interface to tighten or lax the TPE restrictions. You can see the
values in this proc directory:

/proc/sys/tpe/

softmode	- log what would be denied but don't actually deny. default off
strict		- enforce some TPE features even on trusted users. default on
check_file	- check file owner/mode in addition to directory. default on
group_writable  - check if the file/directory is group writable. default on
kill		- kill the offending process and its parent when it gets denied
		  execution from TPE, unless it's root. default off
log		- whether to log denied execs to the ring buffer. default on
log_max		- maximun parent processes in a single log entry. default 50
log_floodburst	- number of log entries before logging is disabled. default 5
log_floodtime	- seconds until re-enabling logging after floodburst. default 5
paranoid	- enforce the trusted path restrictions root too. default off
hardcoded_path	- use with caution! a list of directories, separated by colons,
		  that the trusted path will be restricted to; nothing outside
		  this path may be executed/mmaped. default to empty (off)
trusted_gid	- gid of trusted users who TPE is not enforced. default 0 (off)
trusted_invert	- changes what "trusted_gid" means; if set, users in the gid
		  will be the only ones whom TPE is enforced. default 0 (off)
admin_gid	- files belonging to this group are treated as if they're owned
		  by root; TPE is not enforced on them. default 0 (off)
dmz_gid		- users in this gid can't exec anything at all. default 0 (off)

Edit the /etc/sysctl.d/tpe.conf file to change the defaults of these various
features.

Compatibility Issues

Test this module before deploying to a critical system, especially if you're
not using a kernel in the above "Supported Kernels" list.

Trusted Path Execution will cause some programs to stop functioning correctly.
If it doesn't result in a kernel BUG or other stack-trace to show up in dmesg,
it's the program that needs fixing, not this module. A way to work around this
problem is adding the uid of the user these broken programs run as to the
"Trusted GID" group, so TPE is not enforced on them. You can set this group id
in /proc/sys/tpe/trusted_gid 

List of programs known to fail while TPE is active for the user running it:

* wine
* dropbox
* kernel modules that make use of kernel tracing (ftrace, kprobes, etc)

This module will not work on systems where loadable kernel module support is
disabled at compile time (CONFIG_MODULES not being set).

This module requires many LSM hooks in order to work, and will error out when
security is disabled at compile time (CONFIG_SECURITY not being set).

If you custom compile your own kernel and want TPE, consider using grsecurity
instead of this module.

This module may conflict with ksplice, but I've never actually tested that
theory. If you use that software, let me know whether or not you run into
problems when using this module.

TPE Coverage

This code was stared as a "proof of concept" and turned into a usable security
tool. It may not cover all entry points that TPE needs to cover. If you find a
way to bypass the trusted path, let me know, and I'll update this code.

===============================================================================

BUGS

There are currently no known bugs. If you discover one, please report it to the
author.

Looking at the kpatch implementation, I was able to simplify this module.

Trusted Path Execution is a feature of grsecurity, and I originally pulled code
from that project to make this module.
